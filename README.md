# Arduino Uno Q Robotics Shield



> [!NOTE]
> Currently, I am unsure what pin on the Arduino Uno Q would connect to pin 17 on the camera connectors.
> 
> I choose SOC_GPIO_18, but there could be a correct pin that I wasn't able to find in the linux device tree of the Uno Q.
> 
> Once I am sure of which pin goes in pin 17 of the camera connector, I will add the second camera connector.
